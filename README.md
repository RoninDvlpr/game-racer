Javascript Pseudo 3D Racer
==========================

An Outrun-style pseudo-3d racing game in HTML5 and Javascript. This project was originally 
developed by Jake Gordon (@jakesgordon) as a tutorial for pseudo-3d games. It is being ported
to the Animatron Javascript player and turned into a full-fledged game by Brian Clanton 
(@brianclanton) and Andrew Hollenbach (@ahollenbach).
